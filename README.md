## Features

The app features a main view for recording kicks, which allows the user to selection either a timed hour-long session (with a countdown timer on screen) or an unlimited session, which can be as long or as short as the user likes. The view shows the most recent kick recorded, a button to record a kick, and a brief summary of the current status. 

A button below leads to a history view, with kicks listed in a view that can be toggled between all, session, or unlimited. This list shows the date and time for the kick, and the time ellapsed from the previous within a session. 

A second button leads to a graph view, where the user can see kicks listed in a day or week view, and can select a data point to see its details. Buttons allow browsing through the history to see additional days or weeks.
